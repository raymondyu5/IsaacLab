project_crs: "EPSG::32633" # 32633 is WGS1984 UTM 33N; epsg number that corresponds to the required project crs. Look here: https://epsg.io/ "EPSG::40400" for hand samples.
subdivide_task: True # Fine-level task subdivision reduces memory by breaking processing into independent chunks that are run in series. True recommended.
enable_overwrite: False # If set to True, overwrites project that is loaded with load_project_path parameter. Use with caution!
